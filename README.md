I WANT to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day and have them saved in my account.
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
SO THAT I can have this information handy whenever I want to access saved data of my past workouts while I am on the road or in the comfort of my own home.
